### Bearing Covers:

We manufacture Bearing Covers of varying sizes, and hardnesses. We will convert your Bearing into an Idler Roller with a simple Polyurethane Coated Cover.

AUTI manufactures other parts in addition to bearing covers and covered bearings using Urethane Bonded to Metal.

Bearing Covers that use Polyurethane have the following characteristics:

- High Quality
- Durable
- Resilient
- Excellent Shock Absorption
- High Load-Bearing
- High Rebound
- Dimensional Stability
- Abrasion Resistant
- Reduced Down Time
- Reduced Maintenance Costs

Bearing Covers are sometimes referred to as Covered Bearings and Coated Bearings. All of our Urethane Bearing Covers, Polyurethane Covered Bearings, and Urethane Coated Bearings are Made in the USA.
