#### Polyurethane Bumpers that Work:

Our urethane can be custom formulated to suit your exact needs. Why buy off the shelf when AUTI will produce the product that solves your problem?

AUTI manufactures both High Rebound, and Low Rebound Urethane Bumpers. 

A low-rebound bumper will stop movement without bouncing back (energy absorbing). Our Low Rebound Polyurethane Bumpers will stop the product, and reduce noise.

If you need high-rebound, your movement will bounce off our urethane bumper therefore conserving energy. Our High Rebound Polyurethane Bumpers will keep your products moving down your assembly lines.

#### Polyurethane Slides, Cutter Sticks, and Cutting Sticks:

AUTI produces polyurethane slides to help you meet your automation needs. Please contact us with your specifications, and we will engineer your urethane slides. We also manufacture cutting sticks or web sticks, and cutter sticks of different lengths.
