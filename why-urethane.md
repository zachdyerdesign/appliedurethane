Listed below is some more specific information regarding Urethane's Properties and Advantages against other materials.

**Abrasion Resistance:**

Polyurethane has a high resistance to abrasion, and a lower degree of friction compared with many materials in its class. The harder the material, the lower the friction coefficient of the material. In numerous laboratory test, polyurethane has shown a definite wear advantage when compared to rubber, and other materials. In fact, polyurethane showed a wear advantage, against many forms of steel.

**Adhesion:**

Polyurethane elsastomers will bond adhesively to metals, and to most plastics. Sometimes this bond is actually stronger than the elastomer itself. Strong bonds can be obtained by applying adhesive to metal or plastic. Next, the polyurethane elastomer is casted , and a very strong bond is created.

**Compression:**

Polyurethane elastomers have a better response to compressive loading. This helps to add to its excellent performance in various applications such as caster wheels, truck tires, cutting and feed rolls, and metal-forming pads.

**Environmental Resistance:**

Polyurethane elastomers have a very good resistance to a variety of adverse conditions encountered in most business, production, and manufacturing applications including oil refining, mining, printing, and numerous other applications. In fact, polyurethane's chemical makeup is more stable against hydrocarbon solvents, and has a higher resistance to oxidation compared to its counterparts.

**Hardness:**

Items created with polyurethane elastomers that are exposed to rough abrasive or cutting action conditions far outlast similar parts made from metals, plastics, conventional rubber, and other materials. Polyurethane elastomers are known to have significantly better aging properties than other materials including rubber. Polyurethane has a higher chemical resistance than other materials. Polyurethane really stands out when it is exposed to high oil content, and various solvents compared to other materials in its class.
