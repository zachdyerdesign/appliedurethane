### Choosing the right inserts and liners 

Your chuck/ shell should have a number on it that corresponds with the numbers in the chart.
#25 chuck uses a #25 insert, liner
If there is not a number, measure the inside dimension of the chuck, shell.
On the price chart, there is a column labeled outside dimension.
The outside dimension of the insert, liner is slightly larger than the inside dimension of the chuck, shell.
